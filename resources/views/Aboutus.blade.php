                <strong> guidelines apply to book content, including title, cover art, and product description</strong>  
                <p>
                As a bookseller, we believe that providing access to the written word is important, including content that may be considered objectionable. We carefully consider the types of content we make available in our stores and review our approach regularly, listening to feedback and investigating concerns from our customers. We reserve the right to remove content from sale if we determine it creates a poor customer experience.
                Vendors are responsible for adhering to our content guidelines. We invest significant time and resources to enforce these guidelines. We'll remove content that does not adhere to these guidelines and promptly investigate any book when notified of potential noncompliance. If we remove a title, we let the Vendor know and they can appeal our decision.
                </p>
